<p align="center">
  Semantic infrastructure for deterministic cognition and meaning.
</p>

## 🚀 Mission
USS builds the missing semantic layer in AI systems — the layer that transforms raw tokens into structured, auditable, deterministic meaning.

We design architectures for:

- **UST** — Universal Semantic Tokens  
- **SCP** — Semantic Control Protocol  
- **USR** — Universal Semantic Runtime  
- **ORCH-C** — Deterministic Multi-Agent Orchestrator  
- **SynCE** — Synchronized Cognitive Engine  
- **USO** — Universal Semantic Operators (implementation layer)

USS is where foundational semantic theory becomes real software.

## 🧠 Core Philosophy
Modern AI lacks a stable meaning layer. USS provides:

- deterministic semantic interpretation  
- token-level structure  
- runtime governance  
- reproducible cognitive behaviors  
- multi-engine orchestration  

Our focus is **alignment through structure**, not through vibes or heuristics.

## 🧩 Core Repositories

### 🔹 **uss-USO**  
Universal Semantic Operators — small, composable operators for semantic execution.  
A minimal, deterministic alternative to agent frameworks.

### 🔹 **uss-synce**  
The Synchronized Cognitive Engine — domain reasoning and semantic planning.

### 🔹 **uss-scp-control-protocol**  
Formal definition of SCP, the execution and control layer for semantic engines.

### 🔹 **uss-ust-semantic-tokens**  
The canonical specification for Universal Semantic Tokens.

### 🔹 **uss-orch-c**  
Deterministic orchestrator — structured multi-agent execution with explainable routing.

## ⭐ Vision
A future where meaning is structured, cognition is deterministic, and AI systems behave like engineered systems — not stochastic fog.

USS is building the semantic foundation for that future.
